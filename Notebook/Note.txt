Dataset
The dataset used for training the machine learning model is sourced from Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams. It contains information about students' demographics, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, and their corresponding math scores.

Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using a supervised learning algorithm, such as a decision tree or random forest, to predict the math score based on the input features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
